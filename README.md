# books

Some ideas I want to explore is writing books on: 

10x10x Management: management's multiplier effect 

Scrum in large and small codebase: no size fits all 

Iterative continious improvement: how to improve work without sacrifacing current product


---When I can get to add something public, I can easily do it here. 
---I will avoid making it a blog, so I will go back to it at a later point.
